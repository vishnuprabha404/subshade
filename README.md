# SubShade - Subdomain Enumeration Tool

SubShade is a bash script for automated subdomain discovery and validation. It finds subdomains for a given domain and checks which ones are actively responding to HTTP requests.

## Features

- üîç **Subdomain Discovery**: Uses multiple techniques to find subdomains
- ‚úÖ **Live Subdomain Detection**: Validates which subdomains are actively responding
- üßπ **Duplicate Removal**: Automatically sorts and removes duplicate entries
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress during execution
- üìÅ **Clean Output**: Saves results to an organized text file

## Prerequisites

Before running SubShade, you need to install the following tools:

### Required Tools

#### 1. assetfinder
A tool for finding subdomains using various passive sources.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Using Go (recommended)
go install github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder@latest

# Alternative: Download binary from releases
# Visit: https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder/releases
```

#### 2. httprobe
A tool for probing URLs to check if they're alive.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Using Go (recommended)
go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe@latest

# Alternative: Download binary from releases
# Visit: https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe/releases
```

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux/macOS/WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Shell**: Bash 4.0 or higher
- **Go**: Version 1.19+ (for installing tools)

### Built-in Tools (Usually Available)
The following tools are typically pre-installed on most Unix-like systems:
- `sort` - For sorting and removing duplicates
- `cat` - For reading files
- `wc` - For counting lines
- `mkdir` - For creating directories
- `rm` - For removing files
- `echo` - For displaying output

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the script:**
   ```bash
   # If using git
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd subshade
   
   # Or download main.sh directly
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.sh
   ```

3. **Verify dependencies are installed:**
   ```bash
   # Check if tools are available
   which assetfinder
   which httprobe
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./main.sh <domain>
```

### Examples
```bash
# Find subdomains for example.com
./main.sh example.com

# Find subdomains for a specific organization
./main.sh tesla.com
```

### Output
The script will:
1. Display progress information during execution
2. Create a file named `<domain>-subdomains.txt` containing all live subdomains
3. Show statistics about discovered subdomains

Example output:
```
WELCOME user

Initializing ...

Gathering subdomains of example.com

Total number of subdomains found : 25

Checking for active subdomains, this might take a while ...

SUBSHADE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED !

Total number of active subdomains after sorting is : 12

Check 'example.com-subdomains.txt' for the list of active subdomains
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"assetfinder: command not found"**
   - Install assetfinder using the instructions above
   - Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`

2. **"httprobe: command not found"**
   - Install httprobe using the instructions above
   - Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x main.sh`

4. **No results found**
   - The domain might not have publicly discoverable subdomains
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try with a well-known domain like `tesla.com` or `github.com`

### Setting up Go PATH (if needed)
```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```
